function r3_vol3d = resize(vol3d, flag)

% =========================================================================
% This function reduces the size of the Field matrix by a factor of 3 by 
% averaging every group of three adjacent voxels. This process combines 
% smaller neighboring voxels into a single larger voxel, effectively 
% downscaling the matrix while preserving the overall data structure.
